## 0 &ensp; Notes about the Starter Code

## 1 &ensp; Warmup
### 1.1 &ensp; Reading the list name
Write a function called `readListName()` that doesn't take in any parameters and returns the current text inside the input textbox with id `#todo-list-name`. You can test this function inside the Chrome Inspector Console (`Right Click > Inspect`; there should be a tab labeled `Console`).

### 1.2 &ensp; Reading the password
Similarly, write a function called `readPassword()` that returns the current text inside the input textbox with id `#todo-list-password`. You can test that your function works with the Chrome Inspector Console.

## 2 &ensp; Reading all the to-do items
Now we're ready for the real challenge. Write a function called `readTodoItems()`

## 3 &ensp; Message Div

## 4 &ensp; Interface with `api.meet.sh`
